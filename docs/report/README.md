# README

This folder contains two templates. The GHE group can currently support report writing in the following formats:

- MS Word (.docx)
- Google Docs (.gdoc)
- R Markdown (.rmd)
- Quarto (.qmd)

We cannot support report writing in Overleaf and LaTeX at this point.

## Computational Competencies

Within the GHE group, we have experience in using STATA and R. Students are free to use any other programming language for data analysis (Python, SQL, Julia, etc.), but no support can be provided in code reviewing. Students using R for their data analysis are free to use .R scripts or literate programming tools, such as R Markdown and Quarto. 

# Files

## ghe-style-guide.docx

This style guide was prepared to provide a general report outline template for use with MS Word or Google Docs. Sections contain guidance on specific content for the respective section. The outline is a suggested outline, but students are welcome to re-organise sections to their specific needs. 

## report-outline.qmd

This report outline is for students that are competent in using literate programming tools. The outline itself is the same as in the ghe-style-guide.docx, but with the actual guidance in each section removed. Students are free to split this documents into several documents with smaller chunks.
